					<h2>About</h2>
					<p>Perched atop hills and filled-in marshland at the entrance to one of the Pacific’s largest natural harbors,
                    San Francisco has had an outsized influence on the history of California and the United States. Originally a Spanish 
                    (later Mexican) mission and pueblo, it was conquered by the United States in 1846 and by an invading army of prospectors 
                    following the 1848 discovery of gold in its hinterland. The Gold Rush made San Francisco a cosmopolitan metropolis with 
                    a frontier edge. The great 1906 earthquake and fire destroyed much of the city but barely slowed its momentum; San Francisco 
                    barreled through the 20th century as a center of wealth, military power, progressive culture and high technology.</p>
